# Hogwarts-House-Quiz
This is a basic JavaScript project. The user is given a series of 10 questions which they can response to with a, b, c, or d. Based on their responses, they will be sorted into one of the houses of Hogwarts. They will also receive the percent chance they had of being sorted into each of the houses at the end of the program, as well.
